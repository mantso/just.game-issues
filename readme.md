# Official JUST.GAME bug reports
You most likely arrived on this page as result of the [JUST.GAME testnet](https://just.game). We want to make [JUST.GAME](https://just.game) as smooth and reliable as possible, but we will need your help. Because JUST.GAME is still in beta, there's a chance of bugs and other annoyances. When you experience any issues or bugs in the game, _we want you to tell us._ 


## How?
We expect a lot of people to partake in the beta. In order for us to effectively help  all of you,  we will require you to report issues in a specific format. First, [navigate to the "issue creation" page](https://github.com/mantso/just.game-issues/issues/new). It will prompt you for a title of your issue, and a description.

For the title, make it relevant to the issue you are experiencing. _(Example: game freezes when opening boxes)_.

For the description, we require you to follow the format we provide below. All you need to do is copy this template, and fill in the answers. _(We provide example answers on each of the questions so that you have a good idea of what the answers should look like)_.

**Are you having difficulties in reporting an issue, or do you have questions?** Feel free to visit our ever so helpful and friendly [community staff in our Discord server](). They will gladly help you out.
